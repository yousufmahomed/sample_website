        The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform
        was designed mainly for ebooks like the
        <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>
        book</a> and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough
        HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more
        traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman
        Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a
        short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of
        American literature.

        <em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
        by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long
        precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
        particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
        little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
        driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
      Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
      jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler
      alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
